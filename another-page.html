                Jane Rosenberg got her start as a courtroom sketch artist drawing prostitutes in New York's night court
                in 1980.
            </p>
            <p>
                Forty-three years later, Rosenberg's newest subject was former President Donald Trump, whose arraignment
                in Manhattan on Tuesday on 34 charges of falsifying business records provided her the opportunity to
                draw two viral sketches of the defendant.
            </p>
            <p>
                "My hands are just flying," Rosenberg said of the time sketching Trump. "My fingers were going faster
                than my brain, and then it was over."

                The New Yorker is publishing Rosenberg's sketch of Trump on the cover of its April 17 issue, the first
                time in its history the magazine printed a courtroom sketch on its cover. For a magazine whose cover art
                frequently etches a place in popular culture and history, The New Yorker's decision to print Rosenberg's
                sketch marks a historic point for not only Rosenberg's career but also courtroom sketch art broadly.
            </p>
            <p>Rosenberg came up as an artist in the late 1970s when abstractionism was the norm, rather than the
                realism portrayed in her courtroom work.

            </p>
            <p>"I did portraits in my kitchen as a closet portrait artist," she said.</p>
            <p>
                She eventually found herself working as a portrait artist in Provincetown, Massachusetts, in the late
                1970s, though she was looking for a more stable way to earn money as an artist.
            </p>"I went home and watched it on my tiny black and white TV, called my parents and said, 'I'm on TV',"
            Rosenberg said.


            <p>
                In courtrooms where photography is prohibited, artists offer the public a way to see inside court
                proceedings, selling the right to their art to media outlets for a profit. Rosenberg learned about
                courtroom sketches during a lecture, then made her way to court with some lawyer friends from college to
                try the artform.
            </p>
            <p>
                A week later, Rosenberg was sitting in the jury box of a Manhattan courtroom to sketch a defendant
                during an arraignment. She then sold that first professional courtroom sketch to NBC News, which
                photographed the sketch and put it on television.
            </p>
            <p>"I went home and watched it on my tiny black and white TV, called my parents and said, 'I'm on TV',"
                Rosenberg said.

            </p>
            <p>That first success set Rosenberg on a path to sketching famous witnesses and defendants such as John
                Gotti, Ghislaine Maxwell, and Tom Brady (though that sketch went viral for not fully capturing the
                likeness of the famous football player), having her art featured in museums and the Library of Congress,
                and being one of the few people to attend Trump's arraignment in person.

            </p>
            <p>
                Rosenberg said she had been anticipating the moment of Trump's arraignment for weeks.

            <p>
                When asked about social media users claiming there are similarities between the sketch of the former president and Dr. Seuss's Grinch, Rosenberg defended her work. Trump was looking "a little bit unhappy," in her own words.
            </p>
            <p>
                "No way – I never would do intentional Grinch," Rosenberg said. "First of all, I tried to show what expression I saw; that's what I tried to capture."
            </p>
            <p>
                If anything, Rosenberg said she enjoyed sketching the former president.


            </p>
            <p>
                "He's got a great head to draw, his hair is a little like a hat, he's got a lot of expression in that face – he's fun to draw," she said.
            </p>
            <p>
                Rosenberg said she has no plans to sell the physical Trump sketches, despite the interest expressed in the pieces. She has already sold the rights to use the sketches to multiple outlets, including directly to ABC News.
            </p>
            <p>
                Selling her work to newspapers and media outlets across the world and the accomplishment of landing the New Yorker cover are enough for the viral artist, who arguably has reached the mountaintop of courtroom sketches.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Maybe that's it – I've reached the pinnacle and it's over – maybe there's nothing else," she said. "But you never know; I'll just keep going on."
